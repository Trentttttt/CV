    "The purpose of this document is to briefly introduce the tree-based machine learning models and their application to predicting personal loan acceptance at the universal bank. Decision tree (also called, classification and regression tree, CART) model on one hand, has good interpretability and are computationally light to construct, and on the other hand complex enough to capture the ground truth. Therefore, tree-based models are very widely used in practice to address classification or regression problems. Both the modeling details, the case study, and the Python code are included in this document. \n",

For a regression problem, $Y_i$ is a continuous variable; for a classification problem, $Y_i$ is discrete and $Y_i\\in\\{0,1\\}$ in this document. We use $\\hat f(\\cdot)$ to denote a supervised learning model trained on the data set $\\mathcal D$ that maps from feature $X$ to label $Y$. For a classification problem, we use $\\hat g(X)$ to denote the estimated positive outcome probability given feature $X$, i.e., $\\hat g(X)=\\hat{\\mathbb P}[Y=1|X]\\approx \\mathbb P[Y=1|X]$, also trained on $\\mathcal D$.\n",

    "- **$k-$Nearest Neighbors** model has superior performance when distance in $X$ is a good approximation of similarity in $Y$ and the size of the training set $n$ is large. In this case, nevertheless, $k$NN model is also very slow since it needs to calculate the distance between a new data point to original ones in the training set. Furthermore, $k$NN may suffer from the notorious curse of dimensionality ([Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Curse_of_dimensionality)), i.e., when the feature space's dimension $p$ is high, it requires a huge amount of data to ensure the neighbor of a testing data point has sufficiently many data in the training set.\n",

    "With these observations, in the next section, we introduce a new approach called **classification and regression tree (CART)** that is flexible enough to be (highly) non-linear and is reasonably fast to perform both training and prediction, thus addressing the issues associated with logistic regression and $k$NN in a smart fashion.

    "The **decision tree** (sometimes also called classification and regression tree, CART, so we use decision tree and CART interchangeably in this course) model mimics the process of making decisions/predictions by a hierarchical series of binary or multiple choice questions. For example, the following figure illustrates a decision tree to predict whether a student has walked to school or taken a bus to school.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"sample-of-a-decision-tree.png\" width=750>\n",
    "\n",
    "For this decision tree, it is quite intuitive to write out the hierarchical decision/prediction rules:\n",
    "\n",
    "- First, check the weather:\n",
    "  - If it is sunny, then check the time:\n",
    "     - If the time is more than 30 minutes, predict the student has walked to school.\n",
    "     - If the time is less than 30 minutes, predict the student has take a bus to school.\n",
    "  - If it is cloudy, then check whether the student is hungry:\n",
    "     - If he is hungry, predict the student has walked to school.\n",
    "     - If he is not hungry, predict the student has taken a bus to school.\n",
    "  - If it is rainy, then predict the student has taken a bus to school. \n",
    "\n",
    "The decision/prediction process above can be generalized to the classification problem we consider. A tree consists of one or multiple nodes, so that one node has at most parent node and zero or more child nodes. The node that has no parent is called the root node, whereas the node that has no child node is called a leaf node. To simplify notation, we only consider **binary tree** ([Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Binary_tree)) in this document. Specifically, each non-leaf node has at most 2 children. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Associated with each leaf node $\\tau$ of a decision tree is a subset of data points in the training set (denoted as $\\mathcal D(\\tau)$), the features of which satisfy all the decision rules of the ancestor nodes of node $\\tau$. Clearly, $\\mathcal D(\\tau)$ for all leaf nodes $\\tau$ is a partition of $\\mathcal D$. We also define the number of positive outcomes in $\\mathcal D(\\tau)$ as $n_1(\\tau)$, and the number of negative outcomes thereof as $n_0(\\tau)$. Hence, the number of data points in $\\mathcal D(\\tau)$ satisfies that $n(\\tau)=|\\mathcal D(\\tau)|=n_1(\\tau)+n_0(\\tau)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Associated with each non-leaf node $\\tau$ of a decision tree is a binary decision rule: Whether a feature $X_j$ is above a threshold $c_{\\tau}$. If $X_j\\le c_{\\tau}$, go to the left child of $\\tau$; otherwise, go to its right child. We also define the data set associated with a non-leaf node $\\tau$, denoted by $\\mathcal D(\\tau)$, as the union of the data sets associated with its left and right children: $\\mathcal D(\\tau)=\\mathcal D(\\tau_L)\\cup\\mathcal D(\\tau_R)$, where $\\tau_L$ (respectively $\\tau_R$) is the left (respectively right) child of $\\tau$. We can also recursively define the number of positive (respectively negative) outcomes for each non-leaf node as the sum of its children nodes' number of positive (respectively negative) outcomes: $n_i(\\tau)=n_i(\\tau_L)+n_i(\\tau_R)$ for $i=0,1$. \n",
    "\n",
    "From a graphical perspective, a decision tree can be viewed as recursive binary partitioning of the feature space, where each partition is along one feature $X_j$ according to the decision true $X_j\\le c_{\\tau}$ associated with a non-leaf node $\\tau$. In fact these two representations of decision tree are equivalent to each other.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the following figure, we plot a decision tree of depth 2 with 3 non-leaf nodes and 4 leaf nodes in both the tree prepresentation (the right figure), and the recursive partitioning structure (the left figure). For this case, the first feature is $X[0]$ and the second feature is $X[1]$. The tree first splits on $X[1]\\le 0.0596$, and then the left subtree splits on $X[0]\\le-0.4177$ whereas the right subtree splits on $X[0]\\le 1.1957$.\n",

    "Essentially, to make the tree as compact as possible is to reduce overfitting and variance, whereas to increase the tree purity is to reduce underfitting and bias. Therefore, fitting a tree requires a smart balance between bias and variance. Under a unified regularization frame, to fit a tree $\\hat f(\\cdot)$ is to find the optimal classification tree model such that\n",

In particular, for the case of building a decision tree with complexity parameter $cp$ (see the Python code below), $R(f)=cp \\cdot T$, where $T$ is the number of leaves in the tree $f$. This implies that each additional leaf should decrease the loss/impurity by at least $cp$. Otherwise, the total loss will actually increase.\n",

    "The bad news is the above optimization problem to exactly build a maximally compact and pure tree is NP-hard ([Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness)). However, we have good news that this can be well approximated with an efficient greedy heuristic strategy for recursive partitioning. The idea of the heuristic is that we iteratively grow the tree from a root node so that each split from a parent node to two children nodes would increase the (current) purity of each leaf to the largest extent possible. \n",

    "This subsection is devoted to discussing how we can make predictions on new data with the decision tree $T$ trained on $\\mathcal D$. For a new data point $(Y,X)$, the decision tree $\\hat T$ will uniquely prescribe (by following the decision rules) which leaf node $\\tau$ the feature $X$ belongs to, which is generally very fast. Assume that, for the training data that are in node $\\tau$, there are $n_1(\\tau)$ positive outcomes and $n_0(\\tau)$ negative outcomes. We predict that the conditional probability of positive outcome is\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=red>\n",
    "$$\\hat g(X)=\\hat{\\mathbb P}[Y=1|X]=\\frac{n_1(\\tau)}{n_1(\\tau)+n_0(\\tau)}$$\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "    \n",
    "For instance, a leaf node $\\tau$ has 100 data points in $\\mathcal D$, of which 80 are with a positive outcome ($Y=1$) and 20 are with a negative outcome ($Y=0$), then for any $X\\in\\tau$, we have $\\hat g(X)=\\hat{\\mathbb P}[Y=1|X]=0.8$. \n",
    "\n",
    "Similar to the cases of logistic regression and $k$NN, with the predicted conditional probability of a positive outcome $\\hat g(X)=\\hat{\\mathbb P}[Y=1|X]$, we can construct a classifier using the threshold approach:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\hat Y=\\hat f(x)=\n",
    "\\begin{cases}\n",
    "1,\\mbox{ if }\\hat g(X)\\ge t\\\\\n",
    "0,\\mbox{ otherwise}\n",
    "\\end{cases}\n",
    "$$\n",
    "where $t\\in[0,1]$ is the threshold for the classifier $\\hat f(\\cdot)$. Then, all the common out-of-sample tricks/evaluation metrics such as confusion matrices, overall accuracy, 0-1 Loss, precision, recall, false-positive rate, false-negative rate, ROC, and AUC, etc. can be computed, and the generalization error/performance can be estimated using a testing set.

    "For the problem with a continuous outcome variable $Y$, the decision tree trained on the data set $\\mathcal D=\\{Y_{i},X_{ij},1\\le i\\le n,1\\le j\\le p\\}$ is called a regression tree. When fitting a regression tree, the main idea is still to recursively split the feature space so that each split could increase the (current) purity of the tree to the largest possible (or to reduce the impurity to the most). The impurity metric we use to train a regression tree is the squared loss. \n",
    "\n",
    "- The squared loss a leaf node $\\tau$ is given by:\n",
    "<font color=red>\n",
    "$$\\mathcal L(\\tau)=\\frac{1}{|\\tau|}\\sum_{(X,Y)\\in\\mathcal D(\\tau)}(Y-\\bar{Y}_{\\tau})^2,\\mbox{ where }\\bar Y_{\\tau}:=\\frac{1}{|\\tau|}\\sum_{(X,Y)\\in \\mathcal D(\\tau)}Y\\mbox{ is the mean outcome of the node }\\tau$$\n",
    "</font>    \n",
    "The squared loss of a non-leaf node $\\tau$ is given recursively by:\n",
    "<font color=red>\n",
    "$$\\mathcal L(\\tau)=\\frac{|\\tau_L|}{|\\tau|}\\mathcal L(\\tau_L)+\\frac{|\\tau_R|}{|\\tau|}\\mathcal L(\\tau_R)$$\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "Therefore, we could fit a regression with the following recursive partition:\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "-------\n",
    "<font color=red>\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization and input:** All the data $\\mathcal D$ are put in the root node. Input the stopping criteria (such as **max tree depth** and/or **complexity parameter**, which is the minimum decrease in squared loss of each recursive split).\n",
    "- **Step 1:** For each leaf node $\\tau$, split this node into two children nodes according to cutoffs in each feature $X_j$ and compute the squared loss of each resulting tree.\n",
    "- **Step 2:** Of the new trees constructed in Step 1, pick up the one with the smallest squared loss, denoted as $\\hat T^*$. If $\\hat T^*$ satisfies the stopping criteria, then stop and **Output $\\hat T^*$**. Otherwise, repeat **Step 1**. \n",
    "\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "---------\n",
    "    \n",
    "So the above procedure gradually grows a tree until some stopping criteria are met. A regression tree (same thing applies to a classification tree) may overfit the training data when it is too complex, as illustrated by the following figure. Therefore, we may want to prune a tree (i.e., to remove some leaves) to reduce over-fitting.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"RT.png\" width=600>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Next, we discuss how to make predictions on new data with the regression tree $\\hat T$ trained on $\\mathcal D$. For a new data point with feature $X$, the decision tree $\\hat T$ will uniquely prescribe which leaf node $\\tau$ the feature $X$ belongs to. We predict that the outcome given feature $X$ is\n",

    "</font>\n",
    "which is the expected outcome of the data points in the training set and in node $\\tau$.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Similar for linear regression all the common out-of-sample evaluation metrics such as rooted-mean-squared-error, $R^2$, and mean-absolute-error, etc. can be computed, and the generalization error/performance can be estimated using a testing set. \n",
    "\n",
    "We also remark that the regression tree model is essentially a step-function model, illustrated as below, where the outcome $Y$ is a user's interest on a specic news topic, and the feature is time, denoted by $t$. The recursive splitting process essentially strikes a balance between bias (measured by the squared loss impurity, denoted as $L(f)$ in the figure below) and variance (measured by the model complexity, denoted as $\\Omega (f)$ in the figure below). To many splits will decrease the bias but increase the variance of a regression model.\n",

    "Finally, we conclude this document with some brief discussions on when we should use tree-based models:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Trees are non-linear. So, if there is some intrinsic non-linear relationship between the features and the label, using tree-based models are recommended. In particular, trees leverage a clever data structure that makes the $k$NN idea scalable.\n",
    "\n",
    "- Because of the feature space splitting rule, tree-based models are not sensitive to scaling, so featuring engineering is not that important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- A single CART is generally very interpretable, but may suffer from the overfitting problem. We can finetune a lot of parameters to avoid overfitting."
