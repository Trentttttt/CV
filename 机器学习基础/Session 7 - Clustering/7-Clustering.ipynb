    "The purpose of this document is to briefly introduce an important non-supervised learning method called clustering, with applications to Netflix data to cluster movies according to their features. As discussed at the beginning of this course, unsupervised learning means that we do not have a label ($Y$) to supervise/dictate whether our model makes sense. The goal of clustering is to split the feature space into different clusters so that data points in the same cluster are as close to each other as possible, whereas data points in different clusters are as far away from each other as possible. Both the modeling details, the case study, and the Python code are included in this document. \n",

    "Unsupervised learning ([Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsupervised_learning)) refers to one type of machine learning that seeks to find patterns, relationships, and structures in data, without being optimized to solve a particular predictive task (i.e., there is no outcome variable $Y$ associated with the problem). **Clustering** refers to a specific type of unsupervised models the goal of which is to segment data into a set of homogeneous clusters of observations to generate insights. Although clustering models do not have a label $Y$, one usually utilizes the clustering results as features or labels to devise follow-up predictive models and/or actionable strategies. Typical examples of clustering include:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Image segmentation:** To segment image into different parts. The segmentation results may be used for facial recognition, for example.  \n",
    "- **Customer segmentation:** To segment customers into different classes. The firm may adopt different promotional strategies to different customer segments.\n",
    "- **Product segmentation:** To segment products into different classes. A seller may target different customers with different product segments.\n",
    "\n",
    "In this document, we denote the training set for clustering as $\\mathcal D=\\{X_{ij},1\\le i\\le n,1\\le j\\le p\\}$, which only has features, but not the outcome variable. The goal of clustering is to split the data set $\\mathcal D$ into $k$ non-overlapping clusters $\\mathcal C_1,\\mathcal C_2,...,\\mathcal C_k$ such that $\\cup_{1\\le l\\le k}\\mathcal C_l=\\mathcal D$ and $\\mathcal C_l \\cap\\mathcal C_m=\\emptyset$ for $l\\ne m$. At a high level, the objective for clustering is:\n",

    "\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "    \n",
    "--------------\n",
    "\n",
    "Here similarity and disimilarity are measured by distances. Before discussing the definitions of distances between data points and between clusters, we first illustrate clustering as the following figures:\n",

    "\n",
    "It is also important to understand the high-level purposes of clustering:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Exploration:** You may use clustering for some initial data exploration to understand whether the data are coherently splitted into groups and, if so, how many groups there are. \n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data Partitioning:** You may also want to divide the data into different groups before further processing. It is possible that you train different supervised learning models on different groups.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Unsupervised feature extraction:** Clustering is also a natural approach to generate additional features. For example, you could add the group labels or the cluster distances into the feature space."

    "Clustering relies on the measure of distance both between data observations and between clusters. As discussed in the document for the $k$NN model, we assume the feature space is associated with a distance function (sometimes also called norm, see [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Norm_(mathematics))), which we denote as $d(X_1,X_2)$, which measures the distance between two features $X_1$ and $X_2$. In most applications, we use the Euclidean distance (sometimes also called the Euclidean norm or the $L^2-$norm, see [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Euclidean_distance)) most often. For two features $X_1=(X_{11},X_{12},...,X_{1p})$ and $X_2=(X_{21},X_{22},...,X_{2p})$, their Euclidean distance is given by\n",
    "\n",
    "$$d(X_1,X_2)=\\sqrt{\\sum_{j=1}^p(X_{1j}-X_{2j})^2}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the distance between different data observations, we could define various distances between two clusters $\\mathcal C_1$ and $\\mathcal C_2$:\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Single linkage:** Distance between points that are closest to each other:\n",
    "$$\\min d(X_i,X_j)\\mbox{ where }X_i\\in\\mathcal C_1,X_j\\in\\mathcal C_2$$\n",
    "- **Complete linkage:** Distance between points that are farthest to each other:\n",
    "$$\\max d(X_i,X_j)\\mbox{ where }X_i\\in\\mathcal C_1,X_j\\in\\mathcal C_2$$\n",
    "- **Average linkage:** Average distance computed over all pairs of observations in the two clusters:\n",
    "$$\\mbox{Average of } d(X_i,X_j)\\mbox{ where }X_i\\in\\mathcal C_1,X_j\\in\\mathcal C_2$$\n",
    "- **Average group linkage:** Distance between centers of each cluster:\n",
    "$$d(\\mu_1,\\mu_2)\\mbox{ where }\\mu_i\\mbox{ is the center of }\\mathcal C_i,\\mbox{ i.e., }\\mu_i=\\frac{1}{|\\mathcal C_i|}\\sum_{j\\in \\mathcal C_i}X_j$$\n",
    "where $|\\mathcal C_i|$ is the number of observations in $\\mathcal C_i$.\n",
    "- **Ward's method:** How much the sum of squares will increase if we merge them:\n",
    "$$\\sqrt{\\frac{n_1n_2}{n_1+n_2}}d(\\mu_1,\\mu_2),\\mbox{ where }\\mu_i\\mbox{ is the center of }\\mathcal C_i,\\mbox{ and }n_i=|\\mathcal C_i|\\mbox{ is the number of observations in $\\mathcal C_i$}$$\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "To conclude this section, we remark that, because clustering involves working with distances, it is necessary to preprocess the data set $\\mathcal D$ by **standardization** or **normalization**. Besides the common standardization approach to substract mean and divide by standard deviation, we could also use the following normalization approach to normalize by the range of the feature:\n",
    "\n",
    "$$\\tilde X_{ij}=\\frac{X_{ij}-X_j^{\\min}}{X_j^{\\max}-X_j^{\\min}},$$\n",
    "where $X_j^{\\max}=\\max\\{X_{ij}:1\\le i\\le n\\}$ and $X_j^{\\max}=\\min\\{X_{ij}:1\\le i\\le n\\}$. By definition, this normalization will pull all the features to the range $[0,1]$. **Question**: Why we do not need to the data preprocessing of normalization or standardization for the movie genre case (presented below)? \n",
    "\n",
    "In the following, we first introduce the Netflix movie genre clustering problem. Then, we present two most intuitive clustering models and discuss how they can be used in the Netflix movie genre case."

    "Hierarchical clustering (sometimes also referred to as agglomerative clustering) is an intuitive clustering algorithm. The clustering method starts with each data observation in a cluster of its own. Then, it greedily merges the two most similar clusters.

    "Another (probably more) widely used clustering algorithm is the so called $k-$means clustering. The idea of $k-$means is to minimize the sum of squared distance between each data point in $\\mathcal D$ and the center of the cluster it belongs to. Specifically, we define the center of $\\mathcal C_l$ as $C_l$ and $C(X_i)$ as the cluster center $C_l$ closest to $X_i$:\n",

    "\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "This above optimization problem, unfortunately, is NP-hard ([Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NP-hardness)). However, we have the socalled $k-$means algorithm as an efficient heuristic to obtain the clusters. The algorithms works as follows:\n",

    "------------\n",
    "\n",
    "<font color=\"red\">\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Initialization:** **Input** data set $\\mathcal D$ and the number of clusters $k$.\n",
    "- **Step 1:** Pick $k$ random points $\\{C_1,C_2,...,C_k\\}$ in the feature space as the cluster centers. \n",
    "- **Step 2:** Assign each data point $X_i$ to its closest cluster center $C(X_i)$.\n",
    "- **Step 3:** Re-compute the cluster centers $\\{C_1,C_2,...,C_k\\}$. If the cluster centers do not change, **stop** and **output** $\\{C_1,C_2,...,C_k\\}$. Otherwise, **repeat Step 2**.\n",
    "\n",
    "</font>\n",
    "\n",
    "--------\n",
    "\n",
    "The $k-$means algorithm is one version of the **Expectation-Maximization (EM)** algorithms, a broad family of machine learning algorithms used for prediction. Step 2 is the maximization (implemented as a minimization here) stage whereas Step 2 is the expectation stage of the $k-$NN algorithm. See this [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Expectation%E2%80%93maximization_algorithm) for more. We illustrate the $k-$means algorithm using the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"kmeans.png\" width=1000>\n",
    "\n",
    "A key question in $k-$Means clustering algorithm is how to set the number of clusters $k$. We define the total dissimilarity of a clustering structure $\\{C_1,C_2,...,C_k\\}$ as\n",
    "\n",
    "$$W=\\sum_{i=1}^nd^2(X_i,C_l),\\mbox{ where }C_l\\mbox{ is the cluster center closest to }X_i.$$\n",
    "\n",
    "In general, $W$ will decrease as $k$ increases. The way to pick up the optimal $k^*$ is to find the number of clusters $k$ where there is a **sharp decrease in successive differences** of $W$. This is called the \"elbow method\", as illustrated in the following figure.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"elbow.png\" width=700>\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "Although $k-$Means is a non-supervised learning algorithm, we can actually use a $k-$Means fitted on a training set to make predictions of which cluster a new data observation in the testing set belongs to. Specifically, in $k-$Means model, the clusters are fully determined by the cluster centers: Clusters are partion of the feature space into regions closest to each of the cluster centers. This is called Voronoi diagrams of the cluster centers. Therefore, for a new data observation $X$, we only needs to find the center that is closest to $X$, $C(X)=C_l$, and assigns a label $\\mathcal C_l$ to this new data point. We illustrate the partition of the feature space for $k-$means as the following figures, the left of which is with $k=15$ and the right of which is with $k=5$.\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"voronoi.png\" width=1000>\n",
    "\n",
    "The above nature of the $k-$Means algorithm suggests that the cluster boundaries are equivi-distant to the cluster centers. This will give rise to two limitations of the $k-$means algorithm. In either case, more advanced clustering methods should be adopted.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Correlations.** $k-$Means captures distances better than correlations, as illustrated by the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"cov.png\" width=750>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, the Gaussian Mixture Model (GMM, [Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mixture_model#Gaussian_mixture_model)) will work (much) better.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Shapes.** $k-$Means cannot model complex shapes, as shown in the following figure:\n",
    "\n",
    "<img src=\"simple.png\" width=750>\n",
    "\n",
    "In this case, it is recommended that you use the manifold learning model ([Wiki Page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nonlinear_dimensionality_reduction#Manifold_learning_algorithms)).\n",
    "\n",
    "Finally, we compare the hierarchical clustering approach and the $k-$means clustering approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "--------------------\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Hierarchical Clustering** works well for small data sets. It is a convenient method if one is not sure about the number of clusters since it reports the results for all $k$'s between 1 and $n$. Another benefit is that one can visualize how clusters are nested.\n",
    "- **$k-$means Clustering** is suitable for a large data set if we know the number of clusters $k$. If not, one can use the elbow approach to determine the optimal value of $k$. As an unsupervised learning approach, $k-$means actually minimizes the squared error, which makes $k-$means a well-defined optimization problem. $k-$means dicates that cluster boundaries equi-distant to the centers, which makes the model incompetent for data with correlations and the clusters with complex shapes.\n",
